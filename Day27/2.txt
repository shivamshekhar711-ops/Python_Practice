# Set :- 


# list = [ 234,45,55]
# tuplee = (7,33,44,5)

# set = { 12,33,44,55}

# => it can not contain any duplicate element. 
# => it can contain only unique elements.
# # => A set is an unordered collection of Unique elements .
# => it does not follow indexing. 
# => it can also contain any type of data similar as List. 
# it is mutable

# Dictionary 

# => it stores data in Key value pair format. 
# => it is also unordered , that means , it does not support indexing. 
# => The key must be unique. 
# => it is Mutable . but we can change only the value not Key .
