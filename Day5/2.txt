Variables:- 
=> it is just like a container that stores some values.


## Water Container => it contains some quantity of water.

 a = 5 Mangoes  , 

x = 10   , x => Variable , 10 => value


## Rules to declare a variable :-

1. Variable name always begins with characters, and underscore.

NOtes: character OR alphabets OR Letters

Example: my_name = "Rudra"   => Right

        name1 = "Tridev"    => Right

        2name = "Vicky"     => Wrong

2. Variable names always contain letters , numbers and underscore. it can not contain whitespace and any special characters.

Special Character: #, ? , /, ~, ! , @ ..........

Example:   #my_name = "Vikram"  => wrong

           name@ = "Tridev"     => wrong
           first_name = "Shivam"  => right
           last~name = "Prem"      => wrong

3. Keywords are not allowed to declare a variable.
=> the words that are predefined in any Programming language.
Example: if, for, else, elif, is , break, continue.....................


Example: -
print = "Hello, World!"   ## error

print(print)

4. variable name is case sensitive.

NOTE: Except Structured Query Language(SQL), almost all programming languages are case sensitive languages.

Upperscase => Capital letter
Lowercase => Small letter 

Example: -
x = 11
X = 22222

print(x)
print(X)

here , we can say small x and capital X are two different variables because python is case sensitive language.

5. Variable names should always be meaningful.

Example: student_name, emp_name.........

Student Registration form , EMployee registration form 


name Or student_name

name OR employee_name
