# Assignment operator :-


#+=  ( add and  assign )
#-=  ( subtract and assign )
# *=  ( multiply and assign )
# /=  ( divide and assign )
# %=  ( modulus and assign )
# //= ( floor divide and assign )
# **= ( exponent and assign )



# a  = 10
# b = 23

# print( a + b)



# a  = 10

# b = 23

# a = a + b     # OR a = 10 + 23  => a = 33 

# print("the value of a is : ", a)



# Time Complexity :-

# => time taken by any code to run  is called time complexity.



# Space Complexity :-
# => space taken by any code to run is called space complexity.

# print("the value of a is : ", a)

# Note : a = a + b     and     a += b    both are same thing

# print("the value of a is : ", a)

Bus A => it takes 2 hours to reach the metro station.

Bus B => it takes only 1 hour to reach the metro station.



a = a + b   => it takes more time to run.

a += b      => it takes less time to run.

# Membership operator :-
=> it is used to check the presence of value in a sequence like  list, tuple, string, set, dictionary etc.

Rahul_family = [ 'ravi', 'rahul', 'rohan']

print('rahul'  in Rahul_family)  ##   True

print('Rudra' in Rahul_family)  ## False

in => it returns true if value is present .

not in => it returns true if value is not present .




Rahul_family = [ 'ravi', 'rahul', 'rohan']  # list

print('rahul'  in Rahul_family)  ##   True

print('Rudra' in Rahul_family)  ## False 

print('SHivam' not in Rahul_family)  # true

print('ravi' not in Rahul_family)  # False
